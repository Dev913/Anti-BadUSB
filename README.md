# Anti-BadUSB
A python script that is for temporary uses. WHID Devices Only Detected As Of Right Now!

# OS (Operating System)
* Linux (All Distrobutions as far as i know!)

# Installation
* RUN "python requirements.py" in order to install such prequisites!
* RUN "python abusb.py" to run script!

# Features
* Will NOT let you move mouse after running.
* Will NOT allow you to press Ctrl + C Otherwise... SHUTDOWN!
* Will allow you to type but once USB device is inserted... SHUTDOWN!

# Problems
* Yet to be determined why module does not detect any other devices other than such WHID devices! I have contacted the developer directly on such page of module!
